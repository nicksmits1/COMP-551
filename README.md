## Assignment 2: Regularization and Model Evaluation (Linear Regression)
This project focused on implementing linear regression with non-linear Gaussian basis functions to explore model complexity, bias-variance tradeoffs, and the role of regularization. By analyzing synthetic datasets, the study examined how regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) impact model performance and generalization. The project also incorporated cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and assess the balance between underfitting and overfitting.

## Assignment 3: Classification of Image Data with Multilayer Perceptrons and Convolutional Neural Networks
This project consisted of implementing an MLP from scratch and comparing it to a CNNs (implemented with pytorch) and ResNet (pre-trained model) for classifying medical images from the OrganAMNIST dataset. It explored the impact of architectural choices, data preprocessing techniques, and regularization on classification performance. The project also included experiments with pre-trained models to understand the advantages of transfer learning for image data.

## Assignment 4: Emotion Classification Using LLMs
This project investigated emotion classification using the GoEmotions dataset, comparing traditional machine learning models including Naive Bayes, Softmax, Random Forest and XGBoost with the transformer-based model, BERT. The study explored preprocessing techniques, fine-tuning strategies, and attention mechanisms to evaluate how BERTâ€™s contextual embeddings can be adapted for nuanced sentiment analysis tasks.
